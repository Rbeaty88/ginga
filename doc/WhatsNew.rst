What's New in Ginga?
++++++++++++++++++++

Ver 2.0.20131201230846
======================
Ginga gets trackpad gestures!  The Qt rendering class gets support for
pinch and pan gestures:

* The pinch/rotate gesture works as expected on a Mac trackpad
* The pan gesture is not a two-finger pan but a "non-standard", Qt-specific
  one-finger pan.  These are experimental for now, but are enabled by
  default in this release.

Also in this release there has been a lot of updates to the
documentation.  The developer and internals sections in particular have
a lot of new material.
 

Ver 2.0.20131030190529
======================
The great renaming

I really dislike it when developers do this, so it pains me to do it now,
but I have performed a mass renaming of classes.  FitsImage ended up being
the View in the MVC way of doing things, yet it shared the same naming
style as the model classes AstroImage and PythonImage.  This would have
been the source of endless confusion to developers down the road.  Also,
PythonImage needed to get renamed to something more akin to what it
actually represents.

So the renaming went like this:

* FitsImage -> ImageView
* FitsImage{XYZ} -> ImageView{XYZ}
* PythonImage -> RGBImage

So we have:

* M: BaseImage, AstroImage, RGBImage
* V: ImageView{XYZ}
* C: Bindings, BindMap

I did this in the brand new 2.0 version so at least devs have a heads up
that things will not be backward compatible.

And I apologize in advance for any renaming and support issues this may
cause for you.  Fire up your editor of choice and do a query/replace of
"FitsImage" with "ImageView" and you should be good to go.


Ver 1.5-20131022230350
======================
Ginga gets a Matplotlib backend!
    
Ginga can now render to any Matplotlib FigureCanvas.  The performance using
this backend is not as fast as the others, but it is acceptable and opens
up huge opportunities for overplotting.
    
See scripts/example{1,2,3,4,5}_mpl.py

Also merges in bug fixes for recent changes to astropy, and support for
other python WCS packages such as kapteyn and astLib.


Ver 1.5-20130923184124
======================

Efficiency improvements
-----------------------
Efforts to improve speed of entire rendering pipeline and widget
specific redrawing 

* Decent improvements, Ginga can now render HD video (no sound) at 30
  FPS on older hardware (see scripts/example1_video.py).  This
  translates to a slightly speedier feel overall for many operations
  viewing regular scientific files.
* Fixed a bug that gave an error message of 
  Callback.py:83 (make_callback) | Error making callback 'field-info':
  'Readout' object has no attribute 'fitsimage'

* Version bump


Ver 1.4.20130718005402
======================

New Agg backend
---------------
There is now an Agg rendering version of the ImageView object.

* uses the python "aggdraw" module for drawing; get it here  -->
  https://github.com/ejeschke/aggdraw 
* this will make it easy to support all kinds of surfaces because the
  graphics drawing code does not have to be replicated for each
  toolkit
* see example code in /scripts/example1_agg_gtk.py
* currently not needed for Gtk, Qt versions of the object

New Tk backend
--------------
There is now a Tk rendering version of the ImageView object.

* see ginga.tkw.ImageViewTk
* renders on a Tk canvas
* see example code in /scripts/example{1,2}_tk.py
* you will need the aggdraw module (see above) to use it

AutoCuts
--------
* the ginga.AutoCuts module has been refactored into individual classes
  for each algorithm 
* The Preferences plugin for ginga now exposes all of the parameters
    used for each cut levels algorithm and will save them

Etc
---
* additions to the manual (still incomplete, but coming along)
* lots of docstrings for methods added (sphinx API doc coming)
* many colors added to the color drawing example programs
* WhatsNew.txt file added
